# Style Guide
When working on this bot, please use these spacing conventions: 

```javascript
if (){}
```

```javascript
case "oOo": 
{

} 
break;
```

```javascript
for (){}
```

Please use
```javascript
functionDef(function(a, b, c){

});
```
instead of 
```javascript
functionDef((a, b, c) => {

});
```

For now, please do not use ES6, as I am unsure if that will work with Cloud9. However, once I am able to run it off my computer, I will update it to ES6. [Here is a list of ES6 commands and their ES5 workarounds.](http://es6-features.org/)
