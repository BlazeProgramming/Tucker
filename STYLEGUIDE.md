# Style Guide
When working on this bot, please use these spacing conventions: 

```javascript
if (){}
```

```javascript
case "oOo": {

} break;
```

```javascript
for (){}
```

Please use
```javascript
functionDef(function(a, b, c){

});
```
instead of 
```javascript
functionDef((a, b, c) => {

});
```

This guide is a WIP, and I plan to include more in the future. Thank you!
