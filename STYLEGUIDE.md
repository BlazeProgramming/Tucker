==Style Guide==
When working on this bot, please use these spacing conventions: 

```if (){}```

```case "oOo": {

} break;```

```for (){}```

Please use
```functionDef(function(a, b, c){

});```
instead of 
```functionDef((a, b, c) => {

});```

This guide is a WIP, and I plan to include more in the future. Thank you!
